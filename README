COMPILING AND INSTALLING
========================

  In addition to a C compiler you will need the libraries and development
  files for GTK+. On Debian or Debian based systems, like Ubuntu, install the
  package "libgtk-3-dev" and its dependencies. On other systems the package
  might be called "gtk3-devel".  The "configure" script will warn you about
  missing dependencies. Please, see the file INSTALL for details.

  To compile gconjugue do:
  
    ./configure
    make
    make install

  The "make install" should be done as root.
